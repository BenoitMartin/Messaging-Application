It is an application that would allow an user to connect on a server with a couple Login/Password via a login page.
Or he can register himslef via a signup page.
After the connexion, he can choose between two buttons.
One will lead him to the message list, the second will lead him to the writting page.


For this application, we choose to use the API provided by Mr. Ortola.
It has allowed us to create a sign in page and to use a REST api.
We also made a custom language menu. You can use the application in English,French or Spanish.
We've tried to doing it in the most simple way.
